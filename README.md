Making the automatic robot mbot2 move on the field to treat the patient that is Halocode by using MQTT protocol. The tasks are about tracking the position of the objects via camera, coding the Halocode and cyberPi board to be able to publish/subscribe to the command by MQTT broker, and building the path planning for the robot to move to avoid obstacles. My tasks are setting halocode and building path planing using virtual potential field method (by following this link https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/local-path-planning-using-virtual-potential-field-in-python-ec0998f490af).
